<!-- Definition of Inheritance :- Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class can inherit the properties of another class. It is a way of reusing the code by making a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. -->

<!-- The super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods. -->
